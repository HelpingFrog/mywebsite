     <h3  style="text-align: left;">About:</h3>
     <p> Just before graduating in 2016 I secured a position as an apartment maintenance technician,
        which helped me pay my bills as well as teach me a new skillset. As a testament to my quick-learning, 
        in my first year I was recognized as "maintenance Technician of the year" within our parent company
        Despite this, I started realizing that I was pursuing a position in an industry that I wasn't passionate 
        about and after saving enough money to stay afloat without work I terminated myself and began
        spending my time working on skills that were important to me. Now I am Volunteering to help adults earn their GED, 
        teaching myself how to program and getting a better idea of what I want to do for a career.</p>
       
        <p>
          As someone who believes in constant growth and always furthering education I recently found the 
          perfect role for me as a volunteer at Whatcom Literacy Council. Through this opportunity 
          I have come to realize how much of my education I have taken for granted. I now see it 
          as my responsibility to help others who desire to further their education by sharing tools 
          and techniques that have worked for me while also being an all-around supporter of their goals.  
        </p>
